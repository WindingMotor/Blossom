# Blossom ðŸŒ¸

Blossom is a simple Flutter/Dart-based music player designed for playing local mp3 and flac files on mobile devices. It's still a work in progress!

## Building on Linux
**Update Locales**:
   Before building, update the locales by running the following commands in your terminal:
   ```bash
   export LC_NUMERIC="C"
   export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
   ```

   These commands set the numeric locale to `en_US.UTF-8`, enabling compatibility with formatting requirements during the build process.
